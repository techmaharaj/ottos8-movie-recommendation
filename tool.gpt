4. Respond casually: "Based on your mood, I think you'd enjoy some {genre} movies! Let me fetch those for you."
5. Pass the determined `query` parameter to the `fetch-movies` tool and retrieve the movie data.
6. Wait for the results from `fetch-movies` to return.

   - Provide at least three movie recommendations in a markdown list.
   - Include titles, ratings, and release years.
   - Optionally, add a short comment or fun trivia about each movie.
